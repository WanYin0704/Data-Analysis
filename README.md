# Data-Analysis
We have opted to perform a data analysis focused on COVID-19 using a dataset obtained from the Kaggle website. Specifically, we have selected the cases of COVID-19 within the WHO Region of the Americas and Europe for our analysis and
I was in charge of conducting correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between the active cases and death cases for the WHO Region of Americas and Europe.

For the correlation analysis, we employed Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient to examine the potential linear relationship between death cases and active cases within the WHO Region of the Americas and Europe. Pearson's method was selected for calculating the correlation coefficient as both variables—death cases and active cases—are of the ratio-type data. This statistical test is well-suited for measuring the strength of the relationship between these two variables in the context of the region of the Americas and Europe. It's important to note that a **95% confidence level** was assumed, with a significance level **(α)** set at **0.05** for the analysis.
